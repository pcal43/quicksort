# Quicksort

## Features
* **Lightweight item sorting.** Keep your workshop organized quickly and easily.
* **Vanilla-friendly**.         Does not add any new blocks to your server.
* **Serverside-only**.          Does not have to be installed on clients.
* **Fully customizable.**       Define your own quicksort chest types.

## Usage
* Place an emerald or diamond block in the center of your storage area.
* Create a **Quicksorter** by putting regular chest on top of that block.
* Items placed in the Quicksorter will automatically be distributed to nearby chests that contain matching items.

## Fine Points
* The Quicksorter must have a clear line-of-sight to the receiving chests
* The receiving chests must be within a cube-shaped area centered on the Quicksorter.
* The Quicksorter's range depends on the type of block used:
  * Emerald: 5 blocks away
  * Diamond: 10 blocks away
* Items are transferred regardless of whether the item appears to not make it to the chest
